# BambooJS

## What is Bamboo ?

Bamboo stands for "**Ba**ckbone **m**arionette **boo**tstrap. At first, Bamboo
aimed to provide a solid boilerplate for designing responsive client side MVC
applications of any-scale, intended to indented code lovers and python fanatics.
You can find the original project here:
[http://github.com/gloaec/bamboo](http://github.com/gloaec/bamboo)

Given the very promising prospects offered by NodeJS, the objectives were
reassessed. Bamboo provides a very modular architecture based on [Brian
Mann](https://github.com/brian-mann)'s approach of
[Backbone-Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette)
concerning the client-side application and tends to adopt
[Snap](https://github.com/snap-project)'s philosphy for APIs management. So far,
it is based on [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) (for easy
techno-transition matters) and tries not much to stick to rails mechanisms, in
order to ease a potential future technology change.
